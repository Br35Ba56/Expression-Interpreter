Note:
-In the conditional expression operator, the symbols are reversed and the third
 operand represents the condition. The first operand is the value when true and
 the second the value when false
-The logical operators use single symbols not
 double, for example the and operator is & not &&
-The negation operator ! is a postfix operator, not a prefix one
-There are only three relational operators not the usual six and the operator
 for equality is = not ==
